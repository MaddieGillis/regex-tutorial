# Title Matching a Hex Value

In this tutorial will we will explain how to match a hex value using Regex. A hex value is a string of either 3 or 6 digits or the letters a-f. A hex value is often used for programming colors in web design.

## Summary

The expression to use for matching a hex value is `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`. 

A basic break down of this expression is that regex is looking for a string that starts with an optional ‘#’ symbol followed by 6 characters that contain the letters a-f and or the digits 0-9. Or it’s looking for a string that might start with a ‘#’, followed by a string of 3 characters that are a-f and or 0-9. During this tutorial we will break down further what each component means.
